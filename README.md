# Tech for Town

### Why we should do this ?

Non-bankarised people of South-America is close to 78 millions people. 65 % population doesn’t have access to financial services. We believe that in order to solve this problem is necessary to tackle the challenges faced on by the community. Making financial more inclusive. Actually, most of the communities doesn’t trust on financial institutions, some of them fare banks. From the customer perspective, transparency and trust is essential. Even more, they choose by their own initiative to no get involved with financial institutions and use informal services. 

### How we can solve this ?

[Join A Town](http://joinatown.org/) work closely with ONG, Social Entrepreneurs or associations on emerging markets. We want to empower them with technology to make financial services accessible to the communities from the people they trust. Through the existing network, we can build new solutions allowing easy access to a digital identity, secure wallet, make deposits, payments and micro-loans. In that way we want to bring back trust into financial services to the communities.

### How we will build ? 

Join A Town has developed an entrepreneurial methodology for emerging countries. These countries looks very different than hubs like Station F, so how we want to design, launch and support products needs to look different. We need to combine powerful solutions for the emerging countries with teams that have the ability and hunger to solve global goals. 

We want to identify unmet needs within the communities, and develop through early test and iterations new financial solutions communities love, backed by sustainable business model and open-sources technologies. We are a non-profit organization and all the work will shared with the world without any fee.
